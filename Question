Write a program that reads a project file from stdin and writes to stdout the order in which the tasks
should be performed.
Input
For simplicity we represent each task by an integer number from where is the total number
of tasks. The first line of input specifies the number of tasks and the number of rules, such that
and .
The rest of the input consists of rules, one in each line, specifying dependencies using the following
syntax:
This rule means that task number depends on tasks (we say that task is the target
and are dependents).
Note that tasks numbers are separated by single spaces and that rules end with a newline. Rules can
appear in any order, but each task can appear as target only once.
Your program can assume that there are no circular dependencies in the rules, i.e. no task depends
directly or indirectly on itself.
Output
The output should be a single line with the permutation of the tasks to be performed, ordered by
dependencies (i.e. no task should appear before others that it depends on).
To avoid ambiguity in the output, tasks that do not depend on each other should be ordered by their
number (lower numbers first).
